## How to edit content

This template have a CMS support with CosmicJS. You can easily put your content there by creating and linking your CosmicJS account.

In order to customize your portfolio, you must create a CosmicJS account and a new fresh bucket on it. Once done, you must create a `.env` file and add the variables mentioned in `.env.example` file.

```env
# CosmicJS
VUE_APP_COSMICJS_TOKEN=" "
VUE_APP_COSMICJS_BUCKET_SLUG=" "
VUE_APP_COSMICJS_BUCKET_READ_KEY=" "
```

To get `VUE_APP_COSMICJS_TOKEN`, you have to send a post request on `https://api.cosmicjs.com/v2/authenticate` with email and password as your json body.

```json
{
  "email": "your cosmic js email",
  "password": "your cosmic js password"
}
```

After that, you need to create the object type and data we will use. To do that properly and easily, you can import the json file, located [inside the data folder of this repo](https://github.com/aditya-singh9/portfolio/blob/main/data/bucket.json), by accessing import/export settings inside your bucket settings page.

Now, you can customize it with your data through CosmicJS interface!
